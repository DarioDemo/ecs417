			<h3>Experience</h3>
			<p>My work experience at Sparta Global and IBM increased my knowledge of the IT working environment and solidified my decision of pursuing computer science in the future. At Sparta global, I strengthened my problem solving skills by finding the best solution for a range of scenarios. Working with a group improved my teamwork skills as we communicated and listened to each other's ideas to find the best solution. At IBM I created an algorithm for a video game which had to meet certain criteria such as the user being over 18 , must be played by 2 users and must provide a payment to start the game. Creating algorithms like this stimulated my mind into how I should approach the scenario, which is helpful for the future if I go into jobs heavily centralised with software engineering. I also went through truth tables at IBM which developed my mathematical operations in computing. Working part-time in a tutoring company helping GCSE students in Mathematics, Biology and Chemistry developed my leadership and communication skills which are essential in the computing working environment. Being involved in an MRI project with Imperial College developed my research and presentation skills, which are essential for future jobs as well as studying the course.</p>

			<h1>Portfolio</h1>
			<p>Below are some projects I have completed during my time at University. Figure 1 is part of my OOP project where I made a game on Java using a BlueJ IDE. This toke a while to create and a while to learn however it was really fun once I got the hang of it. Figure 2 is a Java Program used for my Automata Coursework, whereby we used the 5 tuple rule to create the program for each FSA. Figure 3 is my essay I created for my Professional and Research Practise, this was done completed with my PRP group where I achieved 87% on the module.</p>
