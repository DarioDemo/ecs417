				<h3>Educational Journey</h3>
				<p>My Educational Journey started off with my GCSE's where I obtained 6 A*-A Grades, 3 B's and 1 C. This was a great achievement for me, and an excellent foundation to continue my educational journey. I then stayed at Chelsea Academy to study Business, Psychology and Media at their Sixth Form for A Levels. I first obtained ACC in my AS Level, then for my final A Level grades I recieved A*AA Grades. Studying Business has shown me how computer systems are used in the real world, such as programs controlling stock adjustment and forecasting future sales using extrapolation. Media Studies has allowed me to explore my creativity by designing magazine covers using Adobe Photoshop. The project taught me how to stay organised with my work whilst meeting deadlines for my client, which is crucial for the computer science course as well as the future workplace. Every Subject I have studied taught me valuable skills for the real world which I will need.</p>
