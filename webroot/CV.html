	<p>Hello, Welcome to my CV.My name is Rostam Satarzai and I am a student at Queen Mary University of London studying Computer Science with a year in Industry. I am interested in Technology as I have always been interested in the way they function. I started to program when I was 15 and I liked going for a new challenge. Starting with Python was great as I enjoyed the new ways it helped me to understand code. My coding journey included several projects, starting with a troubleshooting program for digital devices using python. It asks the user to enter details about their device and the program will then allocate the most sensible solution to their problem. If a solution is not found due to the complexity of the issue, the program contacts a technician to further investigate. I then went on to use SQL in command prompt to create a database management system holding information about students and their subjects. This project was particularly enjoyable as I could apply my creativity by writing queries to information that I had structured using a table. Learning the basics of HTML, CSS and Java to create a blog website, enhanced my coding skills as I used different programming languages. Additionally, me and my peers built a PC, showing me the significance of each component. The failures we went through whilst building the computer demonstrated my commitment to problem solving as we had to find out why certain components didn't work during the build up. With my passion for computers, I completed a science project into how Micro-Transistors are used in processing data. This project allowed me to explore computer hardware and how each transistor functions during computational process, expanding my understanding of computers.</p>
